## Tips and Tricks to Master International Volleyball 2010
 
Now that you have installed the English language patch for International Volleyball 2010, you might be wondering how to play the game like a pro. Well, we have some tips and tricks for you that will help you improve your skills and dominate the court. Whether you are playing solo or online, these tips will help you win more matches and have more fun.
 
Tip #1: Choose the right team. International Volleyball 2010 features 60 national teams, each with different ratings for attack, defense, block, serve, and speed. You can choose any team you like, but some teams are better suited for certain play styles than others. For example, if you like to play aggressively and score points with powerful spikes, you might want to choose a team with high attack and serve ratings, such as Brazil, Russia, or USA. If you prefer to play defensively and rely on your block and counterattack, you might want to choose a team with high defense and block ratings, such as Italy, Poland, or China. You can also customize your team's formation and strategy before each match to suit your preferences.
 
Tip #2: Practice the basics. International Volleyball 2010 has an extensive control model that allows you to perform various moves and techniques, such as different types of serves, passes, sets, spikes, blocks, digs, and feints. However, before you can master these advanced moves, you need to practice the basics. The game has a training mode where you can practice each skill separately or in combination with others. You can also adjust the difficulty level and the speed of the game to suit your skill level. The training mode is a great way to learn the game's mechanics and improve your timing and accuracy.
 
Tip #3: Hit all six thrice. This is a drill that will help you improve your serve accuracy and placement. As mentioned earlier, there are six spots on the opposite side of the net that you can aim for with your serve: left front (LF), left back (LB), middle front (MF), middle back (MB), right front (RF), and right back (RB). The drill is simple: hit each spot three times in a row without missing or hitting out of bounds. You can start with an easy overhand serve and then progress to more difficult serves, such as jump serve or float serve. This drill will help you develop muscle memory and confidence in your serve.
 
Tip #4: Communicate with your teammates. International Volleyball 2010 is a team game that requires coordination and cooperation among players. Whether you are playing with AI teammates or human teammates online, communication is key to success. You can use the chat function or voice chat to communicate with your teammates during the match. You can also use the quick commands feature to give simple instructions or feedback to your teammates, such as "Nice!", "Sorry!", "Set me!", or "Cover me!". Communication will help you avoid confusion and mistakes and create better opportunities for scoring.
 
Tip #5: Study your rotation and assignments. Volleyball is a complex game that involves different roles and responsibilities for each player depending on their position on the court. In International Volleyball 2010, each player has a specific role assigned by the game: setter (S), opposite hitter (OH), outside hitter (LH), middle blocker (MB), libero (L), or defensive specialist (DS). Each role has different tasks and skills that they need to perform well. For example, the setter is responsible for setting up the attacks for the hitters; the opposite hitter is responsible for hitting from the right side of the court; the outside hitter is responsible for hitting from the left side of the court; the middle blocker is responsible for blocking at the net; the libero is responsible for passing and digging in the back row; and the defensive specialist is responsible for passing and defending in any position. You need to know your role and what you are supposed to do in each rotation of the game. You can study your rotation and assignments by reading the game manual or watching some gameplay videos[^4^] .
